# thirdweb create

The easiest way to get started with thirdweb is by using `thirdweb create`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new thirdweb application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using one the defaults thirdweb templates, or by using one of the [official thirdweb examples](https://github.com/thirdweb-example). To get started, use the following command:

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create
# or
yarn thirdweb@latest create
# or
pnpm thirdweb@latest create
```

This will prompt you to choose between "Next.js", "Create React App" and "Vite". You can also pass them as a flag:

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create --next
# or
npx thirdweb@latest create --cra
```

This will also prompt you to choose between TypeScript or JavaScript, you can also pass them as a flag:

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create --typescript
# or
npx thirdweb@latest create --javascript
```

You can also use the shortcute `--js` or `--ts`.

An example of using both flags at the same time:

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create --next --ts`
```

One example of using the `--template` flag:

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create --template nft-drop
# or
yarn thirdweb@latest create --template nft-drop
# or
pnpm thirdweb@latest create --template nft-drop
```
